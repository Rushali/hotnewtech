         <h3>How to get a menstrual cup out</h3>
         <p>Because getting your cup stuck inside of you on first use is terrifying, and frantic googling in the bathroom doesn't always prove effective - putting this text series from Judith's first time at the top of this post:</p>
         <img class="section-img" src="../assets/cup/getthemenstrualcupout.png" alt="A text chain about how to get the cup out of your body - the advice is 'sometimes going #2 makes it feel like it‚Äôs gonna come out - So doing the same pushing movement with the pelvic floor makes it come out easier''">
         <p>If you're in a little less of a bind, hear more about our review of the cup and our first times on the podcast:</p>

         <p>Rushali & Judith both are enthusiastic users of menstrual cups, reusable silicone devices that capture menstrual fluid.</p>
          <p>Given that menstrual cups are a little technically difficult and have not reached mass consumption yet despite being around since the 30s, thought it would be a fun episode topic to mix things up.</p>
          <p>Check out the podcast episode above to hear about our first times, ratings, pros & cons and more.</p>
          <h3>Wait, the 30's?</h3>
          <p>Seriously. Check out this gorgeous patent by Leona W. Chalmers. </p>

          <h2 class="section-header">The Fundamentals</h2>
          <p>Once you have A-frame and AR.js imported into your HTML, you need to create a scene comprised of these two main components:</p>
          <h3>Marker</h3>
          <p>The marker (pattern or barcode), image or location that the camera identifies to activate the object.
          </p>
          <h3>Object</h3>
          <p>The content displayed once the marker is recognized - like an image, text, 3d object, etc. 
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-header">Our App</h2>
          <h3>Custom Marker</h3>
          <p>We went through 8 markers until we figured out the limitations of custom markers.</p>
          <img class="section-img" src="../assets/ar/thewinningmarker.png" alt="Screenshot of all the 8 markers we tried before getting to one that worked.">
          <h3>Custom Object</h3>
          <p>Here was our custom object, a png:</p>
          <img class="hero-img" src="../assets/new.png" alt="he word new as would be seen on a sticker on an item in store inventory trying to attract new customers.">
          <p>All together, the basic code looks like this:</p>
          <img class="section-img" src="../assets/ar/code.jpg" alt="Attempt at being helpful with a screenshot of the scene code including imports, scene makrer and object.">
          <p>Here's how it looks when it works. I have a photo of the marker on my mobile device, am holding it up to the camera and the AR experience is displaying our object.</p>
          <img class="section-img" src="../assets/ar/arworking.gif" alt="Judith testing out the custom web AR experience and it working for the first time">
          <h2 class="section-header">Try our custom AR experience:</h2>
          <p>If you want to see our AR experience, take a photo of this marker with your phone or a secondary device:</p>

          <p>Then click <a href="augmentedReality.html" target="blank">here</a> and hold up the photo to the camera.</p>

          <h2 class="section-header">Making your own AR experience</h2>
          <h3>But first, do you like funny stories?</h3>
          <p>So, you might notice on A-Frame's website they don't really advertise their AR capabilities. Since we couldnt find AR on the A-Frame website but knew from heresay it was a possibility, we googled "aframe ar" and followed the first tutorial that came up:</p>
          <img class="section-img" src="../assets/ar/aframegoogleresults.png" alt="Screenshot from our google search of aframe ar that shows the tutorial we followed and the tutorial we should have followed">
          <p>That first 2017 tutorial caused us some challenges detailed below, like why are these markers so limited?</p>
          <p>Well, turns out there is actually an <a href="https://aframe.io/blog/arjs3/" target="blank">updated tutorial from 2020</a>, the 3rd result in that google search, that extends the marker to be an image or location - much cooler!</p> 
          <p>But actually the simple marker tutorial seems a little more explicit and simple for beginners.</p>

          <p>So choose your poison - if you just want a basic understanding of how it works, <a href="https://aframe.io/blog/arjs/" target="blank">the 2017 tutorial</a> is nice.</p> 
          <p>If you want to make something really cool, <a href="https://aframe.io/blog/arjs3/" target="blank">go for 2020</a>!</p> 
          <p>And always check the date of your tutorials!</p>
          <h3>Getting started</h3>
          <p><a href="https://aframe.io/blog/arjs/" target="blank">The 2017 tutorial</a> is great to follow, but make sure you use the most current JS imports for aframe and AR.js as the ones in the tutorial are out of date and will make it buggy when you try to make a custom marker. </p>
          <p>Also, check the basic starter scene out on <a href="https://codepen.io/jeromeetienne/pen/mRqqzb">this code pen</a> with a <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/data/images/HIRO.jpg" target="blank"></a>hiro marker:</p>
          <h3>Trip ups we had that maybe you can avoid:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If you want a custom marker, it needs to be a simple black and white design, you need to add the code preset='custom' in your a-marker-camera, and make sure your JS imports are the most current ones.</li>
            <li>We ran into a CORS error with our custom marker asset, but when we spun up a local server that issue resolved. Open your terminal to the folder of your project and run: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080</li>
            <li>Anticipate asking your user for 3 permissions - 2 camera permissions and 1 location permission.</li>
            <li>My computer fan was gasping for air, took a lot of processing power</li>
          </ul>

            <h2 class="section-header">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall, we reccommend trying out A-frame because it's instantly gratifying, web based, fun, and an easy intro to AR in the web.</p>
            <p>To hear us chat about the pros, cons and ratings while sitting in our seperate closets for optimum audio, tune into the podcast üëá</p>
