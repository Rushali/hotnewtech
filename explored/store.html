          <p>Of our instagram audience of 15 at the time (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/hotnew.tech/" target="blank">are you following us yet? We need you!)</a>, the results were split down the middle. Is this information failure in itself? What exactly is information failure? And does hash solve the problem? We dicuss most of that in the podcast üëá</p>

          <p>Our hash world was modeled after Sima the matchmaker and her singles with lists of criteria.
          <p>Here is an example of what Aparna's criteria list looked like from the show:</p>
          <img class="section-img" src="../assets/hash/aparna.png" alt="Aparna's list of criteria.">
          <p>Turning Aparna into a javascript object was very fun, but it's not clear if that was hash fun, javascript fun or aparna fun. You can see the beginnings of our hash simulation here:</p>

          <h2 class="section-header">The Fundamentals</h2>
          <p>There are three fundamental concepts of building a model in hash - agents, behaviors and messaging.</p>

          <h3>Agents</h3>
          <p>The objects in the simulations. So in our world the agents would be the singles like Aparna and Pradyhuman and the matchmaker, Sima.</p>
          <h3>Behaviors</h3>
          <p>The activity of the object. So in our world, we had a matchmaking.js that was attached to Sima‚Äôs agent and a dating.js that was attached to the singles. This is where the magic would happen - the logic, the movement, the filtering through criteria. 
          <h3>Messaging</h3>
          <p>The trickiest conceptual part of Hash - an agent can‚Äôt affect the behavior of another agent. It must a send a ‚Äúmessage‚Äù to an agent and then the agent can read the message and change it‚Äôs behavior.</p>

          <h2 class="section-header">Tips for making a simulation:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The little running person is the play button.</li>
            <li>Press pause as soon as you can - the simulation does not auto pause so will eat up all of your processing power.</li>
            <li>Hash Cloud is newly released so you can have it run on their server instead of your computer. Let us know if you're interested and we can try to help you get on that list.</li>
            <li>Don't bother emailing them for support but they have an active slack channel and you can easily sign up for 30 min office hours on Thursday with all of your questions.</li>
          </ul>
            <h2 class="section-header">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Sadly, we probably created more information failure than resolution. We did not get our simulation running nor solve any world problems, though we spent 3 sessions working on it. Sigh.</p>
            <p>Overall, if you like playing with data sets, like being an early adopter and are very comfortable with javascript or python give it a shot and let us know what you think!</p>
            <p>Otherwise keep an eye on it but give it a minute to get more performant.</p>
            <p>In closing, here's an email from my mom indicating we could be completely wrong:</p>
