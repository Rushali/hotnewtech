          <h3>Hash?</h3>
          <p>Self described as "a free online platform for assembling models of the world." More interestingly, the mission statement begins, "We believe that most bad things in the world are the product of some form of information failure; from economic collapse and the outbreaks of war and disease, to choosing the right life partner or university degree. We‚Äôre on a mission to improve imagination, and help everybody make the right decisions, overcoming information failure once and for all." Sounds cool, right? </p>
          <h3>We became interested in Hash because:</h3>
          <p>Joel Spolsky is chairman of the board (associated with creating Trello, Glitch and Stack Overflow). Don't have to be a trend genius to see where that might lead. Also, the mission statement is juicy and data + ai are cool üëè</p>

          <p>Of our instagram audience of 15 at the time (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/hotnew.tech/" target="blank">are you following us yet? We need you!)</a>, the results were split down the middle. Is this information failure in itself? What exactly is information failure? And does hash solve the problem? We dicuss most of that in the podcast üëá</p>

          <p>Our hash world was modeled after Sima the matchmaker and her singles with lists of criteria.
          <p>Here is an example of what Aparna's criteria list looked like from the show:</p>

          <p>Turning Aparna into a javascript object was very fun, but it's not clear if that was hash fun, javascript fun or aparna fun. You can see the beginnings of our hash simulation here:</p>

          <h2 class="section-header">The Fundamentals</h2>
          <p>There are three fundamental concepts of building a model in hash - agents, behaviors and messaging.</p>

          <h3>Agents</h3>
          <p>The objects in the simulations. So in our world the agents would be the singles like Aparna and Pradyhuman and the matchmaker, Sima.</p>
          <h3>Behaviors</h3>
          <p>The activity of the object. So in our world, we had a matchmaking.js that was attached to Sima‚Äôs agent and a dating.js that was attached to the singles. This is where the magic would happen - the logic, the movement, the filtering through criteria. 
          <h3>Messaging</h3>
          <p>The trickiest conceptual part of Hash - an agent can‚Äôt affect the behavior of another agent. It must a send a ‚Äúmessage‚Äù to an agent and then the agent can read the message and change it‚Äôs behavior.</p>

          <h3>Custom Marker</h3>
          <p>We went through 8 markers until we figured out the limitations of custom markers.</p>
          <img class="section-img" src="../assets/ar/thewinningmarker.png" alt="Screenshot of all the 8 markers we tried before getting to one that worked.">
          <h3>Custom Object</h3>
          <p>Here was our custom object, a png:</p>
          <img class="hero-img" src="../assets/new.png" alt="he word new as would be seen on a sticker on an item in store inventory trying to attract new customers.">
          <p>All together, the basic code looks like this:</p>
          <img class="section-img" src="../assets/ar/code.jpg" alt="Attempt at being helpful with a screenshot of the scene code including imports, scene makrer and object.">
          <p>Here's how it looks when it works. I have a photo of the marker on my mobile device, am holding it up to the camera and the AR experience is displaying our object.</p>

          <h3>But first, do you like funny stories?</h3>
          <p>So, you might notice on A-Frame's website they don't really advertise their AR capabilities. Since we couldnt find AR on the A-Frame website but knew from heresay it was a possibility, we googled "aframe ar" and followed the first tutorial that came up:</p>
          <img class="section-img" src="../assets/ar/aframegoogleresults.png" alt="Screenshot from our google search of aframe ar that shows the tutorial we followed and the tutorial we should have followed">
          <p>That first 2017 tutorial caused us some challenges detailed below, like why are these markers so limited?</p>
          <p>Well, turns out there is actually an <a href="https://aframe.io/blog/arjs3/" target="blank">updated tutorial from 2020</a>, the 3rd result in that google search, that extends the marker to be an image or location - much cooler!</p> 
          <p>But actually the simple marker tutorial seems a little more explicit and simple for beginners.</p>

          <p>So choose your poison - if you just want a basic understanding of how it works, <a href="https://aframe.io/blog/arjs/" target="blank">the 2017 tutorial</a> is nice.</p> 
          <p>If you want to make something really cool, <a href="https://aframe.io/blog/arjs3/" target="blank">go for 2020</a>!</p> 
          <p>And always check the date of your tutorials!</p>
          <h3>Getting started</h3>
          <p><a href="https://aframe.io/blog/arjs/" target="blank">The 2017 tutorial</a> is great to follow, but make sure you use the most current JS imports for aframe and AR.js as the ones in the tutorial are out of date and will make it buggy when you try to make a custom marker. </p>
          <p>Also, check the basic starter scene out on <a href="https://codepen.io/jeromeetienne/pen/mRqqzb">this code pen</a> with a <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/data/images/HIRO.jpg" target="blank"></a>hiro marker:</p>
          <h3>Trip ups we had that maybe you can avoid:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If you want a custom marker, it needs to be a simple black and white design, you need to add the code preset='custom' in your a-marker-camera, and make sure your JS imports are the most current ones.</li>
            <li>We ran into a CORS error with our custom marker asset, but when we spun up a local server that issue resolved. Open your terminal to the folder of your project and run: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080</li>
            <li>Anticipate asking your user for 3 permissions - 2 camera permissions and 1 location permission.</li>
            <li>My computer fan was gasping for air, took a lot of processing power</li>
          </ul>

            <h2 class="section-header">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall, we reccommend trying out A-frame because it's instantly gratifying, web based, fun, and an easy intro to AR in the web.</p>
            <p>To hear us chat about the pros, cons and ratings while sitting in our seperate closets for optimum audio, tune into the podcast üëá</p>

            <p>If that's not enough WebAR for you - we went to the source. The curiosity of what the future of WebAR looks like led us to shooting an email to Nicol√≥ Carpignoli - the current maintainer of AR.js. This episode is an interview with him where we dive into topics like the Web XR device API, w3c and AR js studio and the future. üëá</p>
