          <h3>AR vs VR?</h3>
          <p>Augmented Reality plays with your current reality, adding a layer of something like an image or animation - this is the technology used to make instagram filters that turn your face into a cat.</p>
          <p>Virtual Reality completely immerses you in the experience, like wearing an oculus headset and being under water. </p>
          <p>XR, extended reality, or MR, mixed reality, are both bucket terms for AR and VR.</p>

          <h3>A-Frame?</h3>
          <p>A popular web framework to create VR. Check out the docs <a href="http://www.aframe.io" target="blank">here</a>!</p>

          <h3>AR.js?</h3>
          <p>A library for AR on the Web, enabling Image Tracking, Location based AR and Marker tracking.
          </p>

          <h3>We became interested in A-Frame and AR.js because:</h3>
          <p>AR has applications and potential to improve every field and industry. A-frame has a low barrier to entry to start working with web AR - in the docs promised only 10 lines of html to get started! üëè</p>

        </div>
        <img class="section-img" src="../assets/ar/aframescreenshot.png" alt="Screenshot from aframes website landing page">
        <div class="text">     
          <h2 class="section-header">How it works</h2>
          <p>Once you have A-frame and AR.js imported into your HTML, you need to create a scene comprised of these two main components:</p>
          <h3>Marker</h3>
          <p>The pattern or barcode that the camera identifies to activate the object.
          </p>
          <h3>Object</h3>
          <p>The content displayed once the marker is recognized - like an image, text, 3d object, etc. 
          </p>
          <h3>Seeing it in action</h3>
          <p>Take a picture of the marker or print it out and put it in front of the camera that has the AR experience running. The camera will pick up the marker and then your object will display, following around your marker.</p>
          <h2 class="section-header">Our App</h2>
          <h3>Custom Marker</h3>
          <p>We went through 9 markers until we figured out the limitations of custom markers. We ended up using this:</p>
          <img class="section-img" src="../assets/ar/new.png" alt="Screenshot of the word new that will be used for our custom a-frame marker.">
          <h3>Custom Object</h3>
          <p>We were able to use a png for our object, but we did run into a CORS error getting it recognized. If you have this issue, we suggest going into your folder and running a python server so the resources are from the same domain. Here was our custom object:</p>
          <img class="section-img" src="../assets/new.png" alt="he word new as would be seen on a sticker on an item in store inventory trying to attract new customers.">
          <p>All together, the basic code looks like this:</p>
          <img class="section-img" src="../assets/ar/code.jpg" alt="Attempt at being helpful with a screenshot of the scene code including imports, scene makrer and object.">
          <p>Here's how it looks when it works, "it works" face not included. I have a photo of the marker on my mobile device, am holding it up to the camera and the AR experience is displaying our object.</p>

          <img class="content-img" src="../assets/console.png" alt="Image of the google actions console with our action map which looks like a flow chart.">
          <p>They provide a testing console which gives quick feedback of if your action works as expected:</p>

          <p>JK it is in "alpha test" mode which means we didn't need to get it approved, but you need to send us your email address so we can white list you.</p>
          <p>This is how our deployed action looks in the store:</p>

          <h3>Trip ups we had that maybe you can avoid:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Anticipate relinquishing hella privacy settings to chrome üßê.</li>
            <li>If you want to deploy, you will need to set it up under a business name even for Alpha testing.</li>
            <li>The save button is a little awkward in the console, but hitting enter will save your work.</li>
            <li>Doing anything interesting would require connecting to an API which was not very simple, but let us know if you want to make an ep about it and we will!</li>
            <li>OS is not a blocker for building a google action, it was easy to build a google action on a Mac system and they provide a testing environment that is OS agnostic. However, actually using it was less fun than if it was a native experience.</li>

          <p>Overall we reccommend trying to make one because of high demand in the industry. Soon our kids will be like... ew, you type?</p>
          <p>Ironically I'm too lazy to write out the rest, but we discussed it on the podcast!</p>
