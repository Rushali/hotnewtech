          <h3>AR vs VR?</h3>
          <p>Augmented Reality plays with your current reality, adding a layer of something like an image or animation - this is the technology used to make instagram filters that turn your face into a cat.</p>
          <p>Virtual Reality completely immerses you in the experience, like wearing an oculus headset and being under water. </p>
          <p>XR, extended reality, or MR, mixed reality, are both bucket terms for AR and VR.</p>

          <h3>A-Frame?</h3>
          <p>A popular web framework to create VR. Check out the docs <a href="http://www.aframe.io" target="blank">here</a>!</p>

          <h3>AR.js?</h3>
          <p>A library for AR on the Web, enabling Image Tracking, Location based AR and Marker tracking.
          </p>

          <h3>We became interested in A-Frame and AR.js because:</h3>
          <p>AR has applications and potential to improve every field and industry. A-frame has a low barrier to entry to start working with web AR - in the docs promised only 10 lines of html to get started! üëè</p>

        <div class="text">     
          <h2 class="section-header">The Fundamentals</h2>
          <p>Once you have A-frame and AR.js imported into your HTML, you need to create a scene comprised of these two main components:</p>
          <h3>Marker</h3>
          <p>The pattern or barcode that the camera identifies to activate the object.
          </p>
          <h3>Object</h3>
          <p>The content displayed once the marker is recognized - like an image, text, 3d object, etc. 
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-header">Our App</h2>
          <h3>Custom Marker</h3>
          <p>We went through 8 markers until we figured out the limitations of custom markers.</p>
          <img class="section-img" src="../assets/ar/thewinningmarker.png" alt="Screenshot of all the 8 markers we tried before getting to one that worked.">
          <h3>Custom Object</h3>
          <p>Here was our custom object, a png:</p>
          <img class="hero-img" src="../assets/new.png" alt="he word new as would be seen on a sticker on an item in store inventory trying to attract new customers.">
          <p>All together, the basic code looks like this:</p>
          <img class="section-img" src="../assets/ar/code.jpg" alt="Attempt at being helpful with a screenshot of the scene code including imports, scene makrer and object.">
          <p>Here's how it looks when it works, "it works" face not included. I have a photo of the marker on my mobile device, am holding it up to the camera and the AR experience is displaying our object.</p>
          <img class="section-img" src="../assets/ar/itworks.png" alt="Judith testing out the custom web AR experience and it working for the first time">
          <h2 class="section-header">Try it out!</h2>
          <p>If you want to see our AR experience, take a photo of this marker with your phone or a secondary device:</p>
          <img class="section-img" src="../assets/ar/newpattern.png" alt="Our custom AR marker, a box with the text NEW and a thick black border around it.">
          <p>Then click <a href="augmentedreality.html" target="blank">here</a> and hold up the photo to the camera.</p>

          <h2 class="section-header">Doing it yourself</h2>
          <h3>Getting started</h3>
          <p><a href="https://aframe.io/blog/arjs/" target="blank">This tutorial</a> is great to follow, but make sure you use the most current JS imports for aframe and AR.js as the ones in the tutorial are out of date and will make it buggy when you try to make a custom marker. </p>
          <p>Also, check the basic starter scene out on <a href="https://codepen.io/jeromeetienne/pen/mRqqzb">this code pen</a> with a <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/data/images/HIRO.jpg" target="blank"></a>hiro marker:</p>
          <h3>Trip ups we had that maybe you can avoid:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If you want a custom marker, it needs to be a simple black and white design, you need to add the code preset='custom' in your a-marker-camera, and make sure your JS imports are the most current ones.</li>
            <li>We ran into a CORS error with our custom marker asset, but when we spun up a local server that issue resolved. Open your terminal to the folder of your project and run: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080</li>
            <li>Anticipate asking your user for 3 permissions - 2 camera permissions and 1 location permission.</li>
            <li>My computer fan was gasping for air, took a lot of processing power, potentially try this set up üëá</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="section-header">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Overall, we reccommend trying out A-frame because it's instantly gratifying, web based, fun, and an easy intro to AR in the web.</p>
